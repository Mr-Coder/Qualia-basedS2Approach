\section{Experimental Evaluation}
\label{sec:experiments}

We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluation to validate COT-DIR's capabilities for mathematical reasoning with deep implicit relations. Our evaluation leverages a multi-dataset framework encompassing 11 mathematical reasoning datasets with 13,841 carefully curated high-quality problems, enabling systematic assessment of implicit relation discovery and multi-step reasoning capabilities across diverse complexity levels and linguistic contexts.

\subsection{Experimental Design and Multi-Dataset Framework}

\subsubsection{Comprehensive Dataset Integration with Quality Assurance}

Rather than constructing a single specialized test set, we leverage an extensive multi-dataset evaluation framework that provides comprehensive coverage of mathematical reasoning scenarios. Our framework integrates 11 established mathematical reasoning datasets spanning multiple difficulty levels, languages, and problem types, with systematic quality screening applied to ensure experimental validity.

\textbf{Dataset Scope}: Our evaluation encompasses carefully curated datasets ranging from elementary arithmetic to advanced competition-level mathematics. We utilize complete available datasets and systematically expanded representative samples to achieve robust statistical coverage while maintaining experimental rigor and computational feasibility.

\textbf{Data Quality Assurance}: All problems undergo comprehensive screening through our automated quality pipeline, achieving a 92\% retention rate with mathematical correctness validation (95\% pass rate), semantic coherence assessment (98\% pass rate), and duplicate detection (94\% pass rate). Expert validation on stratified samples confirms high screening accuracy with substantial inter-rater reliability (Îº=0.89).

\subsubsection{Complexity Classification and DIR Score Methodology}

\textbf{Four-Level Complexity Framework}: We establish a rigorous complexity classification system to enable fine-grained performance analysis:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{L0 (Basic)}: Single-step arithmetic operations, direct formula application
    \item \textbf{L1 (Intermediate)}: Multi-step calculations with explicit relationships
    \item \textbf{L2 (Advanced)}: Complex multi-step reasoning requiring implicit relation discovery
    \item \textbf{L3 (Expert)}: Competition-level problems with deep mathematical insight requirements
\end{itemize}

\textbf{DIR Score Computation}: Deep Implicit Relation (DIR) scores quantify the degree of implicit reasoning required for each problem, calculated through:
\begin{equation}
\text{DIR}(p) = \alpha \cdot R_{impl}(p) + \beta \cdot D_{reasoning}(p) + \gamma \cdot C_{connectivity}(p)
\end{equation}
where $R_{impl}$ measures implicit relation density, $D_{reasoning}$ quantifies reasoning depth, and $C_{connectivity}$ assesses cross-step dependencies. Expert annotation and automated analysis validate score consistency (Pearson r=0.91).
