\section{Experimental Evaluation}
\label{sec:experiments}

We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluation to validate COT-DIR's capabilities for mathematical reasoning with deep implicit relations. Our evaluation leverages a large-scale multi-dataset framework encompassing 13 mathematical reasoning datasets with over 87,000 problems, enabling systematic assessment of implicit relation discovery and multi-step reasoning capabilities across diverse complexity levels and linguistic contexts.

\subsection{Experimental Design and Multi-Dataset Framework}

\subsubsection{Large-Scale Dataset Integration}

Rather than constructing a single specialized test set, we leverage an extensive multi-dataset evaluation framework that provides comprehensive coverage of mathematical reasoning scenarios. Our framework integrates 13 established mathematical reasoning datasets spanning multiple difficulty levels, languages, and problem types:
