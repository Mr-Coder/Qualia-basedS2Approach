- Benchmark tests for each reasoning component
- Memory usage profiling during large dataset processing  
- Response time validation under various loads
- Resource utilization monitoring

**Data Pipeline Integrity (DATA-001)**:
- Data flow validation from input to output
- Schema validation at each processing stage
- Error handling for malformed data
- Data consistency checks across transformations

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

**Error Handling Validation (TECH-001)**:
- Exception propagation tests
- Graceful degradation scenarios
- Recovery mechanism validation

**Logging Consistency (TECH-002)**:
- Log format standardization tests
- Log level appropriateness validation
- Performance impact of logging

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

**Security Input Validation (SEC-001)**:
- Input sanitization for mathematical expressions
- API endpoint security testing
- Cross-site scripting prevention

**UI/Backend Decoupling (TECH-003)**:

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- **ARCH-001**: Integration test coverage >80%
- **PERF-001**: Performance baselines established, <2s response time

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- **TECH-001**: Error handling framework implemented
- **TECH-002**: Standardized logging across all modules
- **PERF-002**: Memory monitoring alerts configured

### Accepted Risks

- **SEC-001**: Low probability input validation issues - monitor in production
- UI coupling issues - acceptable for research prototype phase

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Performance metrics**: Response times, throughput, memory usage
- **Error rates**: Exception frequencies, failure patterns  
- **Data quality**: Processing accuracy, validation failures
