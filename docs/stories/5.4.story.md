## Dev Notes

### Mobile Project Setup (Completed)

- Mobile app structure created at `/apps/mobile/`
- React Native with Expo initialized
- Required dependencies configured in package.json
- Directory structure matches story requirements
- Integration strategy documented in `/apps/mobile/INTEGRATION_STRATEGY.md`

### Previous Story Context

[Source: Story 5.1, 5.2, 5.3]

- Story 5.1: Communication Service provides WebSocket infrastructure
- Story 5.2: Real-time collaboration features (chat, whiteboard, video)
- Story 5.3: AI-enhanced grading with notifications
- All use Socket.io for real-time communication

### Architecture Requirements

[Source: architecture/09-mobile-architecture.md]

**Mobile Stack:**
- React Native with Expo
- Socket.io client for real-time
- AsyncStorage for offline data
- React Navigation for routing
- Native modules for performance

### Mobile Communication Architecture

[Source: architecture/03-service-architecture.md#mobile-sync]

```typescript
// Mobile WebSocket Connection
const socket = io(COMMUNICATION_SERVICE_URL, {
  transports: ['websocket'],
  auth: { token: authToken },
  reconnection: true,
  reconnectionAttempts: Infinity
});

// Offline Queue Management
interface OfflineQueue {
  messages: QueuedMessage[];
  operations: QueuedOperation[];
  syncStatus: 'pending' | 'syncing' | 'synced';
}
```

### Push Notification System

[Source: architecture/08-api-specifications.md#push-notifications]

**Firebase Cloud Messaging:**
```javascript
// Notification Types
{
  type: "message" | "ai_response" | "collaboration_request",
  title: string,
  body: string,
  data: {
    roomId?: string,
    messageId?: string,
    deepLink?: string
  },
  priority: "high" | "normal"
}
```

### Offline Sync Protocol

[Source: architecture/05-data-architecture.md#offline-sync]

**Conflict Resolution:**
1. Last-write-wins for messages
2. Operational transformation for whiteboard
3. Server authoritative for grades
4. Client-side queue with retry logic

### Mobile-Specific Optimizations

[Source: architecture/09-mobile-architecture.md#performance]

**Bundle Optimization:**
- Code splitting by feature
- Lazy loading of heavy components
- Image optimization with CDN
- Minimal initial bundle (<2MB)

**Network Optimization:**
- Message batching
- Delta sync for whiteboard
- Compressed WebSocket frames
- Adaptive quality for video

### Cross-Platform State Management

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-sync]

```typescript
// Zustand store with persistence
const useCommunicationStore = create(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      messages: [],
      whiteboardState: {},
      syncStatus: 'idle',
      // ... store implementation
    }),
    {
      name: 'communication-storage',
      storage: createJSONStorage(() => AsyncStorage)
    }
  )
);
```

### Voice Message Architecture

[Source: architecture/04-ai-architecture.md#voice-transcription]

**Speech-to-Text Pipeline:**
1. Record audio using expo-av
2. Upload to Communication Service
3. Process with AI Engine STT
4. Return transcription via WebSocket
5. Store audio URL in MongoDB

### Performance Requirements

[Source: architecture/09-mobile-architecture.md#targets]

- App launch: <2s cold start
- Message sync: <100ms latency
- Offline to online: <5s full sync
- Battery usage: <5% per hour active
- Memory usage: <150MB

### Security Considerations

[Source: architecture/07-security-architecture.md#mobile]

- Biometric authentication option
- Encrypted local storage
- Certificate pinning for API calls
- Secure WebSocket with TLS
- Token refresh on app resume

### File Locations
